# Normalization or Schema Refinement
- A technique of organizing the data in the database
- A systematic approach of decomposing tables to eliminate data redundancy and undesirable characteristics
- Most common technique for the Schema Refinement is decomposition.
- Normalization is used for mainly two purpose:
    - Eliminating redundant (useless) data
    - Ensuring data dependencies make sense, that is, data is logically stored

# Normal Forms
- A normal form specifies a set of conditions that the relational schema must satisfy in terms of its constraints â€“ they offer varied levels of guarantee for the design
- Normalization rules are divided into various normal forms. Most common normal forms are:
  - First Normal Form (1NF) 
  - Second Normal Form (2NF)
  - Third Normal Form (3NF)
